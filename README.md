# PFP_project

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common running injury that results in pain in the anterior portion of your knee. For most runners who are diagnosed with PFPS, the pain will eventually subside and they can return back to normal running routines. However, runners who get PFPS are at risk of reinjury. The analysis performed on this dataset containt three groups: a healthy group, a group currently with PFPS (injured), and a group who had recovered from PFPS. Kinetic, kinematic, and electromyography data was collected at the first and 21st minute of a treadmill run. Each stride at each timepoint was independently processed using Visual 3D. This exploratory analysis sought to answer a couple of different research questions: 

1. Will machine learning models accurately classify individuals as healthy, injured, and recovered? 
2. Does the onset of fatigue impact a recovered individuals classification? 

We plan to release a paper with detailed results on this analysis. This GitHub repository contains opensource jupyter notebooks written in Python 3.0 that can be used by other research groups in their studies.
