This repository contains all necessary files for generating machine learning models to classify subjects. 

1. first_3_pc_scores_concatenator will pull the first three principal component scores for all kinetic/kinematic metrcics and EMG data and put it into one matrix. 
The number of principal components included in the predictive modeling can easily be altered in this notebook. The analysis method (using means or individual strides) 
can also be chosen within this notebook. 
   
2. The folder titled "Classification_of_three_groups" contains different machine learning model approaches to classify the data points as healthy, injured, or recovered 
using leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) and various model hyperparameters. This method is the best approach to selecting appropriate hyperparameters. 
Models are evaluated using mean squared error (MSE), where the lowest MSE is indicative of the best classification. A custom written function LOOCV_prediction is within 
this notebook to accomplish the LOOCV. Models were also tested using the means of each subject's data in addition to individual strides. Using stride data produced much 
better MSE.
   
3. The folder titles "Recovered_fatigue_analysis" uses the healthy and injured strides as training data (binary classification where 1 = healthy and 2 = injured), 
and then tests on the recovered individuals. The hypothesis here is that early in the trial, recovered individuals would run with mechanics and muscle activity more 
similar to healthy individuals and would be classified by the models as being healthy. Once fatigue onset (ie at the later timepoint in the trial), we hypothesized that 
the runners would run more mechanics and muscle activity more similar to injured runners. We plan to publish a paper on these results in the near future.
