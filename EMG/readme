This folder houses scripts for EMG data including:

  1) EMG_data_plotting.ipynb which plots each subjects EMG stride data on its own subplot and exports a .png file of all 11 muscles. 
     Each cubplot contains an EMG waveform representative of a single stride
     
  2) EMG_PCA_wrangling.ipynb is a notebook that takes each EMG waveform for each stride and appends a matrix that is 101 rows long. 
     These matrices will be used for a principal component analysis to detect the patterns within the waveforms that represent differences
     between those with PFPS and healthy individuals.
