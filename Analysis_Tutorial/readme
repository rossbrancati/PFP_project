I created a Jupyter notebook that walks through the machine learning portion of this project. The input file is a matrix of 96 observations and 137 features. 
  -Each observation is a runner at either minute 1 or mintue 21 of a 21 minute treadmill run.
  -Each feature is the score of an associated principal component. For each kinetic, kinematic, and electromyography variable. The principal components that explained 90% of the variability in the data were included for a total of 137 features.
